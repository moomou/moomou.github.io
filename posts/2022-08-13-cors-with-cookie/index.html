<p>CORS stands for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing and is the HTTP mechanism to
allow servers to accept requests from other host locations other than its own.</p>
<p>Getting CORS up and running is not difficult. There are plenty of posts online that will
recommend a starting configuration that looks something like this, in pseudo code</p>
<pre><code>Header().Set(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, &quot;*&quot;)
Header().Set(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot;, &quot;POST, GET, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE&quot;)
Header().Set(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;, &quot;Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Authorization&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration works great and is the default I use; however, it does <em>not</em> work if you need to receive and set cookies in the browser. This short blog post documents what I learnt
about working with cookies with CORS.</p>
<h1 id="setting-cookies">Setting Cookies</h1>
<p>When I needed to set cookies in a server accessed behind CORS, I didn&rsquo;t think anything special was needed as the CORS requests were completing without errors.</p>
<p>Cookies was not getting set however. It turned that browsers (tested on Chrome and Firefox) <em>SILENTLY</em> ignore cookie headers if CORS is not configured correctly.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of errors from browsers, it was not clear to me at first why cookie headers were not
taking effect as I could see from <code>curl</code> that the backend was definitely replying with the correct
cookie headers.</p>
<p>Stumped, I did what every good engineer do at this point, I Googled &ldquo;set cookie header not setting cookie&rdquo; and very quickly CORS came up as a possible culprit.</p>
<p>Turns out, in order for cookie headers to work across origin, the CORS header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
must <strong>not</strong> specify <code>*</code> and instead needs to specify the requesting origin.</p>
<p>To put it concretely, for cookie header to be accepted by a browser, your server need to write, again in pseudo code</p>
<pre><code>Header().Set(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, IncomingRequest.Host)
</code></pre>
<p>After this configuration change, setting cookie via CORS worked.</p>
<h1 id="receiving-cookies">Receiving Cookies</h1>
<p>Now that we can set cookies, receiving cookies on the server should just work automatically, right?</p>
<p>Almost. Fixing the CORS header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> is a pre-requisite to setting and receiving
cookies but turned out two more configuration updates are required.</p>
<p>First, from your web app, you need to make sure your AJAX request specifies <code>withCredentials</code> equal to true
to make a request with cookies, which by default is not forwarded (presumably for security reasons).</p>
<p>Second, backend server needs to reply with <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</code> or else the response
will be dropped.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Interacting with cookie with CORS now works as expected, after many trials and errors, all of which could have been avoided had I read Mozill&rsquo;s excellent MDN docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS</a> first. Oh well</p>
