<p>Over the winter break, I was reviewing Fourier Transform and its various applications.
Fundamentally, Fourier Transform is about a shift in perspective - viewing the same data with a different lens makes some operations easier or faster. This piqued my curiosity about what other fundamental data transformations that I should be aware of. Like everyone since 2023, I jumped to my current preferred chatbot Gemini to learn more.</p>
<p>There are a many! Gemini shared some common ones such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Log Transform, some I learnt briefly in school such as Laplace Transforms and Z-Transforms, but also some I know nothing about such as Radon Transform and Wavelet Transform.</p>
<p>This blog post is about my experience learning about Radon Transform and its application to computed tomography (CT) scan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I share the steps I took to learn about Radon Transform and CT scan and building a toy X ray in Threejs. I also share some reflections on process of learning and writing with LLM. You can find the Threejs app here: TODO</p>
</blockquote>
<details> **tl;dr** I chronicle and share the steps I took to learn how to finetune a LLM model to describe a given audio file on Google's MusicCaps dataset; you can also find the raw jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/moomou/listening-with-llm/blob/master/voixdb_train_dev.ipynb) </details>

<p>I am amazed at what I was able to build over a weekend with an interactive teacher like Gemini, having no prior knowledge about CT scan and Threejs. Almost felt like that I had superpower! However, such superpower is not without its downsides. During the course of my learning, I constantly asked myself what&rsquo;s the point of building the Threejs app? Was I actually learning? Or was I simply reaping dopamine rewards without increasing my skills? Gemini generated a lot of code and definitely could have built the whole thing in one minute.</p>
<p>I was only able to alleviate some of that anxiety by deliberately avoiding some of Gemini&rsquo;s eager help. Forcing myself to write the 2D X ray projection function allowed me to build a mental model for sinograms and ray projections. Only then was I able to onvince myself that I was learning. I am not envious of today&rsquo;s students - it&rsquo;s all too easy to cheat and avoid the hardwork.</p>
<aside>Using Geminit to generate boilerplates such as setting Threejs scene and plotting on HTML canvas is great accelerator that I have no qualms about using!</aside>
